# onhb_map_generator
p5js script that generates the Facebook/Instagram post showing how many teams per state are participating in the 11th edition (and beyond!) of ‘Olimpíada Nacional em História do Brasil’ overlayed on a map of Brazil.

For now it's being hosted at http://mapa_onhb.surge.sh/

Data from the event's first round in 2018 would generate the following map:
